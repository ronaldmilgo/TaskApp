Project 7 - Task Manager

Submitted by: Ronald Milgo

Task Manager is an app that allows users to manage their tasks in an organized way. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, track task completion status, and view tasks based on due dates in a calendar view. The app also persists task data even when the application is closed and relaunched.

Notes

Challenges encountered:

Implementing UserDefaults for data persistence was tricky initially, especially ensuring that the app saves and loads tasks correctly.
Handling task sorting based on completion status and due dates required careful planning to ensure that completed tasks appear at the bottom without affecting the UI responsiveness.
Setting up tab bar navigation with both a task list and calendar view was slightly confusing initially, but with proper linking in the storyboard, everything worked smoothly.
